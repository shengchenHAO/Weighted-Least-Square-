Try to compare the difference between OLS and WLS with Abalone Data Set 

This is a group project I did in Stats 506. In this project we tried to compare the difference between OLS and WLS when there 
is a non-constant variance pattern identified. I was in charge of the python part of this project. The basic idea of this project is to do the diagnostic and carry out WLS regression in different languages(R, SAS, Python).
