# Weighted-Least-Square-

This is a group project I did in Stats 506. There were three people in the group, Eli Schultz, Huan Tan and Shengchen Hao.

In this project we tried to compare the difference between OLS and WLS when there is a non-constant variance pattern identified. I was in charge of the python part of this project. The basic idea of this project is to do the diagnostic and carry out WLS regression in different languages(R, SAS, Python). Since there are different ways to choose weight, we compared the results and find the best weight for the Abalone Data Set.

Abalone_WLS.Rmd file is final version of the project. Abalone_WLS.html is generated with the Rmd file.
