Try to compare the difference between OLS and WLS with Abalone Data Set 

This is a group project I did in Stats 506. In this project we tried to compare the difference between OLS and WLS when there 
is a non-constant variance pattern identified. The basic idea of this prject is to do the diagnostic in different languages(R, SAS, Python). 
Since I was worked in Python I only post my work here.
